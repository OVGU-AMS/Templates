to an internal, inferred model, and calls to a human worker
if it is uncertain. However, the human worker may be also
uncertain. We elaborate on the challenges and solutions to assess
the certainty of the human without disturbing the industrial
process, and to assess label reliability and human certainty in
conventional object classification and crowdworking. Albeit there
are methods for measuring stress, insights on the correlation of
stress and uncertainty and uncertainty indicators during labeling
by humans, these advances are yet to be combined to solve the
aforementioned uncertainty challenge. We propose a solution as
a sequence of tasks, starting with a experiment that measures
human certainty in a task of controlled difficulty, whereupon we
can associate certainty with correctness and levels of vital signals.}

However, the local minima that arise from including data
association in a continuous optimization problem pose
challenges. In addition, optimization is usually performed
either over a fixed or an indefinitely growing time frame.
This either discards valuable past information or is
computationally unsustainable.
Hence, in this work, a flexible continuous optimization

for these issues is proposed. The framework provides a
unified approach to not only include data association but
also multiple motion models and temporary interactions
between objects in a continuous optimization problem. It
leverages the concept of graduated optimization, a
heuristic, which allows to avoid local minima. The proposed
framework's performance is benchmarked on a synthetic

  abstract = {Distributed state estimation and localisation methods have become increasingly popular with the rise of ubiquitous computing, and have led naturally to an increased concern regarding data and estimation privacy. Traditional distributed sensor navigation methods typically involve the leakage of sensor or navigator information by communicating measurements or estimates and thus do not preserve participants' privacy. The existing approaches that do provide such guarantees fail to address sensor and navigator privacy in the common application of model-based range-only localisation, consequently forfeiting broad applicability. In this work, we define a notion of privacy-preserving linear combination aggregation and use it to derive a modified Extended Kalman Filter using range measurements such that navigator location, sensors' locations, and sensors' measurements are kept private during navigation. Additionally, a formal cryptographic backing is presented to guarantee our method's privacy as well as an implementation to evaluate its performance. The novel, provably secure, range-based localisation method has applications in a variety of environments where sensors may not be trusted or estimates are considered sensitive, such as autonomous vehicle localisation or air traffic navigation.},

However, the models in the ensemble often concentrate on similar regions in images. This work proposes a novel method that forces a set of base models to learn different features for a classification task. These models are combined in an ensemble to make a collective classification. The key finding is that by forcing the models to concentrate on different features, the classification accuracy is increased. To learn different feature concepts, a so-called feature distance loss is implemented on the feature maps. The experiments on benchmark convolutional neural networks (VGG16, ResNet, AlexNet), popular datasets (Cifar10, Cifar100, miniImageNet, NEU, BSD, TEX), and different training samples (3, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 per class) show the effectiveness of the proposed feature loss. The proposed method outperforms classical ensemble versions of the base models. The Class Activation Maps explicitly prove the ability to learn different feature concepts.

Due to limited resources, often not only a limited number of samples can be taken, but also the cost and time of the traveled distance between the sample points must be considered. We present an adaptive sampling method that greatly reduces the robot’s travel costs for all common sampling criteria with minimal impact on model accuracy. This is achieved by predicting future sample points based on virtual sampling over a horizon in each iteration of the algorithm and suggesting a next sample point after a cost optimization. The algorithm is simulatively evaluated for application to global exploration and reconstruction of unknown phenomena on a variety of randomly generated phenomena. It is shown that our method vastly outperforms standard adaptive sampling.},

One such guarantee is having different levels of estimation performance achievable by trusted and untrusted users within a sensor network. In the presence of multiple sensor measurements, guaranteeing better estimation performance by the usual means of adding removable noise to measurements is complicated by an alternative for untrusted users to improve their performance: fusing more measurements. Our novel method adds correlated noise to different sensors, restricting the performance gained from fusing additional measurements while guaranteeing better performance to those that can remove it. We extend a cryptographic framework for defining estimation privilege and use this to prove the scheme’s security goals, while simulations demonstrate the effects of parameters in a concrete estimation scenario. A scheme that can ensure such differences in estimation performance between estimators of differing privileges can find applications in priority-based or subscription-based estimation performances in environments where more than one sensor is present.},

We present a method for computing the common Fast Covariance Intersection fusion algorithm on an untrusted cloud without disclosing individual estimates or the fused result. In an existing solution to this problem, fusion weights corresponding to the sensor estimate errors are leaked to the cloud to perform the fusion. In this work, we present a method that guarantees no leakage at the cloud by requiring an additional computation step by the party querying the cloud for the fused result. The Paillier encryption scheme is used to homomorphically compute separate parts of the computation that can be combined after decryption. This encrypted Fast Covariance Intersection algorithm can be used in scenarios where the fusing cloud is not trusted and any information on sensor performances must remain confidential.},

  abstract  = {In networked estimation architectures, event-based sensing and communication can contribute to a more efficient resource allocation in general, and improved utilization of communication resources, in particular. In order to tap the full potential of event-based scheduling, the design of transmission triggers and estimators need to be closely coupled while two directions are promising: First, the remote estimator can exploit the absence of transmissions and translate it into implicit information about the sensor data. Second, an intelligent trigger mechanism at the sensor that predicts future sensor readings can decrease transmission rates while rendering the implicit information more valuable. Such an intelligent trigger has been developed in a recent paper based on a Finite Impulse Response filter, which requires the sensor to transmit an additional estimate alongside the measurement. In the present paper, the communication demand is further reduced by only transmitting the estimate. The remote estimator exploits correlations to incorporate the received information. In doing so, the estimation quality is also improved, which is confirmed by simulations. },

We further improve our proposed method by introducing dynamic weighting of the pseudo-measurements, by aiding compressive measurement reconstruction with Kalman filter estimates and by employing iterative versions of this process. Simulations show that our approach achieves a 37 percent improvement with respect to the mean-square error compared to the traditional Kalman filter with the same number of measurements.

In some scenarios, it is desirable to allow partial leakage of state information, thus distinguishing between privileged and unprivileged estimators and their capabilities. Existing methods that make this distinction typically result in reduced estimation quality, require additional communication channels, or lack a formal cryptographic backing. We introduce a method to decrease estimation quality at an unprivileged estimator using a stream of pseudorandom Gaussian samples while leaving privileged estimation unaffected and requiring no additional transmission beyond an initial key exchange. First, a cryptographic definition of privileged estimation is given, capturing the difference between privileges, before a privileged estimation scheme meeting the security notion is presented. Achieving cryptographically privileged estimation without additional channel requirements allows quantifiable estimation to be made available to the public while keeping the best estimation private to trusted privileged parties and can find uses in a variety of service-providing and privacy-preserving scenarios.},

Using order revealing encryption, we show how an approximate solution to the fast covariance intersection weights can be computed and combined with partially homomorphic encryptions of estimates, to calculate an encryption of the fused result.

This paper aims to develop an overarching framework for the reconstruction of cross-covariances between state estimates obtained in heterogeneous state spaces. The proposed method uses a set of deterministic samples to calculate dependent information. Thus, it allows for a distributed track-keeping of correlations that also encodes the transformation into the local subsystems.

  abstract = {Sensor-based sorting is a well-established single particle separation technology. It has found wide application as a quality assurance and control approach in food processing, mining, and recycling. In order to assure high sorting quality, a high degree of control of the motion of individual particles contained in the material stream is required. Several system designs, which are tailored to a sorting task at hand, exist. However, the suitability of a design for a sorting task is assessed by empirical observation. The required thorough experimentation is very time consuming and labor intensive. In this paper, we propose an instrumented bulk material particle for the characterization of motion behavior of the material stream in sensor-based sorting systems. We present a hardware setup including a 9-axis absolute orientation sensor that is used for data acquisition on an experimental sorting system. The presented results show that further processing of this data yields meaningful features of the motion behavior. As an example, we acquire and process data from an experimental sorting system consisting of several submodules such as vibrating conveyor channels and a chute. It is shown that the data can be used to train a model which enables predicting the submodule of a sorting system from which an unknown data sample originates. To our best knowledge, this is the first time that this IIoT-based approach has been applied for the characterization of material flow properties in sensor-based sorting.},

In previous work, we presented a novel design of an optical belt sorter, which includes an area scan camera instead of a line scan camera. Line scan cameras, which are well-established in optical belt sorting, only allow for a single observation of each particle. Using multitarget tracking, the data of the area scan camera can be used to derive a part of the trajectory of each particle. The knowledge of the trajectories can be used to generate accurate predictions as to when and where each particle passes the separation mechanism. Accurate predictions are key to achieve high quality sorting results. The accuracy of the trajectories and the predictions heavily depends on the motion model used. In an evaluation based on a simulation that provides us with ground truth trajectories, we previously identified a bias in the temporal component of the prediction. In this paper, we analyze the simulation-based ground truth data of the motion of different bulk materials and derive models specifically tailored to the generation of accurate predictions for particles traveling on a conveyor belt. The derived models are evaluated using simulation data involving three different bulk materials. The evaluation shows that the constant velocity model and constant acceleration model can be outperformed by utilizing the similarities in the motion behavior of particles of the same type.},

 abstract = {Sensor-based sorting is a machine vision application that has found industrial application in various fields. An accept-or-reject task is executed by separating a material stream into two fractions. Current systems use line-scanning sensors, which is convenient as the material is perceived during transportation. However, line-scanning sensors yield a single observation of each object and no information about their movement. Due to a delay between localization and separation, assumptions regarding the location and point in time for separation need to be made based on the prior localization. Hence, it is necessary to ensure that all objects are transported at uniform velocities. This is often a complex and costly solution. In this paper, we propose a new method for reliably separating particles at non-uniform velocities. The problem is transferred from a mechanical to an algorithmic level. Our novel advanced image processing approach includes equipping the sorter with an area-scan camera in combination with a real-time multiobject tracking system, which enables predictions of the location of individual objects for separation. For the experimental validation of our approach, we present a modular sorting system, which allows comparing sorting results using a line-scan and area-scan camera. Results show that our approach performs reliable separation and hence increases sorting efficiency.}

  abstract = {With modern communication technology, sensors, estimators, and controllers can be pushed apart to distribute 
  intelligence over wide distances. Instead of congesting channels by periodic data transmissions, smart sensors can decide 
  on their own whether data are worth transmitting. This paper studies event-based transmissions from sensor to estimator. 
  The sensor-side event trigger conveys usable information even if no transmission is triggered. In the absence of data, 
  such implicit information can still be exploited by the remote Kalman filter. For this purpose, an easy-to-implement 
  triggering mechanism is proposed based on a Finite Impulse Response prediction that is compared against a stochastic 
  decision variable. By the aid of the stochastic event trigger, the implicit information retains a Gaussian representation 
  and can easily be processed by the Kalman filter. The parameters for the stochastic trigger are retrieved from the 
  Finite Impulse Response filter, which contributes to reducing the communication rate significantly, as shown in simulations.},

  abstract = {Decentralized data fusion is a challenging task even for linear estimation problems. Nonlinear estimation renders data fusion even more difficult as dependencies among the nonlinear estimates require complicated parameterizations. It is nearly impossible to reconstruct or keep track of dependencies. Therefore, conservative approaches have become a popular solution to nonlinear data fusion. As a generalization of Covariance Intersection, exponential mixture densities have been widely applied for nonlinear fusion. However, this approach inherits the conservativeness of Covariance Intersection. For this reason, the less conservative fusion rule Inverse Covariance Intersection is studied in this paper and also generalized to nonlinear data fusion. This generalization employs a conservative approximation of the common information shared by the estimates to be fused. This bound of the common information is subtracted from the fusion result. In doing so, less conservative fusion results can be attained as an empirical analysis demonstrates.},

Because of the often limited communication resources, a trade-off between the amount of information communicated and the quality of the fusion result has to be made. On the one hand, obtaining the optimal fusion result often needs an infeasible amount of additional information, but on the other hand, conservative methods usually lead to more pessimistic results in comparison. This paper proposes a square root decomposition of the incorporated noise terms to reconstruct the cross-covariance matrices between sensor nodes. To save communication bandwidth, a residual is defined that allows bounding of the cross-covariance matrix with a reduced number of noise terms. The consistency of the proposed method is demonstrated by two simulation examples featuring a linear and a nonlinear setup and is compared with other state-of-the-art fusion methods.},

In previous works, we could show that the sorting quality can be enhanced by replacing the line scan camera, which is normally used, with an area scan camera. By performing multitarget tracking within the field of view, the precision of the utilized separation mechanism can be enhanced. The employed kinematics-based multitarget tracking crucially depends on the ability to associate detection hypotheses of the same particle across multiple frames. In this work, we propose a procedure to incorporate the visual similarity of the detected particles into the kinematics-based multitarget tracking that is generic and evaluates the visual similarity independent of the kinematics. For evaluating the visual similarity, we use the Kernelized Correlation Filter, the Large Margin Nearest Neighbor method and the Normalized Cross Correlation. Although no clear superiority for any of the visual similarity measures mentioned above could be determined, an improvement of all considered error metrics was attained.},

 Abstract                 = {State-of-the-art optical sorting systems suffer from delays between the particle detection and separation stage, during which the material movement is not accounted for. Commonly line scan cameras, using simple assumptions to predict the future particle movement, are employed. In this study, a novel prediction approach is presented, where an area scan camera records the particle movement over multiple time steps and a tracking algorithm is used to reconstruct the corresponding paths to determine the time and position at which the material reaches the separation stage. In order to assess the benefit of such a model at different operating parameters, an automated optical belt sorter is numerically modelled and coupled with the tracking procedure. The Discrete Element Method (DEM) is used to describe the particle–particle as well as particle–wall interactions, while the air nozzles required for deflecting undesired material fractions are described with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The accuracy of the employed numerical approach is ensured by comparing the separation results of a predefined sorting task with experimental investigations. The quality of the aforementioned prediction models is compared when utilizing different belt lengths, nozzle activation durations, particle types, sampling frequencies and detection windows. Results show that the numerical model of the optical belt sorter is able to accurately describe the sorting system and is suitable for detailed investigation of various operational parameters. The proposed tracking prediction model was found to be superior to the common line scan camera method in all investigated scenarios. Its advantage is especially profound when difficult sorting conditions, e.g. short conveyor belt lengths or uncooperative moving bulk solids, apply.},

In order to exploit this structure for an efficient in-network processing, each node in the network is supposed to locally process and combine data from its neighboring nodes. The aspired in-network processing, at first glance, prohibits efficient privacy-preserving communication protocols, and encryption schemes that allow for algebraic manipulations are often computationally too expensive. Partially homomorphic encryption schemes constitute far more practical solutions but are restricted to a single algebraic operation on the corresponding ciphertexts. In this paper, an additive-homomorphic encryption scheme is used to derive a privacy-preserving implementation of the information filter where additive operations are sufficient to distribute the workload among the sensor nodes. However, the encryption scheme requires the floating-point data to be quantized, which impairs the estimation quality.

As a first relaxation of the full-rate communication scheme, it can be shown that each node only has to transmit every second time step without endangering consistency of the fusion result. Also, two data-driven algorithms are introduced that even allow for lower transmission rates, and bounds are derived to guarantee consistent fusion results.

Sensor-based sorting is a machine vision application for which firm real-time requirements need to be respected in order to reliably remove potentially harmful entities from a material feed. Recently, employing a predictive tracking approach using multitarget tracking in order to decrease the error in the physical separation in optical sorting has been proposed. For implementations that use hard associations between measurements and tracks, a linear assignment problem has to be solved for each frame recorded by a camera. The auction algorithm can be utilized for this purpose, which also has the advantage of being well suited for parallel architectures. In this paper, an improved implementation of this algorithm for a graphics processing unit (GPU) is presented. The resulting algorithm is implemented in both an OpenCL and a CUDA based environment. By using an optimized data structure, the presented algorithm outperforms recently proposed implementations in terms of speed while retaining the quality of output of the algorithm. Furthermore, memory requirements are significantly decreased, which is important for embedded systems. Experimental results are provided for two different GPUs and six datasets. It is shown that the proposed approach is of particular interest for applications dealing with comparatively large problem sizes.},

  abstract = {Sensor-based sorting provides state-of-the-art solutions for sorting cohesive, granular materials. Typically, involved sensors, illumination, implementation of data analysis and other components are designed and chosen according to the sorting task at hand. A common property of conventional systems is the utilization of scanning sensors. However, the usage of area-scan cameras has recently been proposed. When observing objects at multiple time points, the corresponding paths can be reconstructed by using multiobject tracking. This in turn allows to accurately estimate the point in time and position at which any object will reach the separation stage of the optical sorter and hence contributes to decreasing the error in physical separation. In this paper, it is proposed to further exploit motion information for the purpose of material characterization. By deriving suitable features from the motion information, we show that high classification performance is obtained for an exemplary classification task. The approach therefore contributes towards decreasing the detection error of sorting systems.},

 abstract = {In the growing field of bulk solids handling, automated optical sorting systems are
of increasing importance. However, the initial sorter calibration is still very time consuming
and the precise optical sorting of many materials still remains challenging. In order to
investigate the impact of different operating parameters on the sorting quality, a numerical
model of an existing modular optical belt sorter is presented in this study. The sorter and particle
interaction is described with the Discrete Element Method (DEM) while the air nozzles required
for deflecting undesired material fractions are modelled with Computation Fluid Dynamics
(CFD). The correct representation of the resulting particle–fluid interaction is realized through
a one–way coupling of the DEM with CFD. Complex shaped particle clusters are employed to
model peppercorns also used in experimental investigations. To test the correct implementation
of the utilized models, the particle mass flow within the sorter is compared between experiment
and simulation. The particle separation results of the developed numerical model of the optical
sorting system are compared with matching experimental investigations. The findings show
that the numerical model is able to predict the sorting quality of the optical sorting system with
reasonable accuracy.},

Given the moments (e.g., mean and variance) of random variable X, it is possible to define the set of all distributions that are compatible with the moments information. This set of distributions can be equivalently characterized by its extreme distributions which is a family of mixtures of Dirac’s deltas. The lower and upper expectation of any function g of X are obtained in correspondence of these extremes and can be computed by solving a linear programming problem. The filtering problem can then be solved by running iteratively this linear programming problem.},

  Abstract                 = {State-of-the-art sensor-based sorting systems provide solutions to sort various products according to quality
 aspects. Such systems face the challenge of an existing delay
 between perception and separation of the material. To reliably
 predict an object's position when reaching the separation
 stage, information regarding its movement needs to be derived.
 Multitarget tracking offers approaches through which this
 can be achieved. However, processing time is typically limited
 since the sorting decision for each object needs to be derived
 sufficiently early before it reaches the separation stage. In this
 paper, an approach for multitarget tracking in sensor-based
 sorting is proposed which supports establishing an upper bound
 regarding processing time required for solving the measurement
 to track association problem. To demonstrate the success of
 the proposed method, experiments are conducted for data-sets
 obtained via simulation of a sorting system. This way, it
 is possible to not only demonstrate the impact on required
 runtime but also on the quality of the association.},

  Abstract                 = {State estimation methods provide the means to extract usable information from sensor data – even in the presence of severe uncertainties. Their results are supposed to be informative and uncertainty-aware estimates at once. In particular, the clear tendency towards networked sensor systems gives rise to many additional challenges in developing
state estimation methods.
This book focuses on a comprehensive study of state estimation techniques in centralized, distributed, and decentralized systems with uncertainties being modeled and incorporated in a systematic fashion. We study an easy-to-implement estimation concept that generalizes and combines basic principles of Kalman filter theory and ellipsoidal calculus. By means of this method, stochastic and set-membership uncertainties can be taken into consideration simultaneously. We discuss different solutions to meet the increasing demand for implementing these estimation algorithms in distributed networked systems and investigate the problem of fusing estimates under unknown cross-correlations and nonlinear dependencies.},

  Abstract                 = {In many dynamic systems, the evolution of the state is subject to specific constraints. In general, constraints cannot easily be integrated into the prediction-correction structure of the Kalman filter algorithm. Linear equality constraints are an exception to this rule and have been widely used and studied as they allow for simple closed-form expressions. A common approach is to reformulate equality constraints into pseudo measurements of the state to be estimated. However, equality constraints define deterministic relationships between state components which is an undesirable property in Kalman filtering as this leads to singular covariance matrices. A second problem relates to the knowledge required to identify and define precise constraints, which are met by the system state. In this article, ellipsoidal constraints are introduced that can be employed to model a bounded region, to which the system state is constrained. This concept constitutes an easy-to-use relaxation of equality constraints. In order to integrate ellipsoidal constraints into the Kalman filter structure, a generalized filter framework is utilized that relies on a combined stochastic and set-membership uncertainty representation.},

  Abstract                 = {Many modern fusion architectures are designed to process and fuse data in networked systems. Alongside the advantages, such as scalability and robustness, distributed fusion techniques particularly have to tackle the problem of dependencies between locally processed data. In linear estimation problems, uncertain quantities with unknown cross-correlations can be fused by means of the covariance intersection algorithm, which avoids overconfident fusion results. However, for nonlinear system dynamics and sensor models perturbed by arbitrary noise, it is not only a problem to characterize and parameterize dependencies between estimates, but also to find a proper notion of consistency. This paper addresses these issues by transforming the state estimates to a different state space, where the corresponding densities are Gaussian and only linear dependencies between estimates, i.e., correlations, can arise. These pseudo Gaussian densities then allow the notion of covariance consistency to be used in distributed nonlinear state estimation.},

  Abstract                 = {Especially in the field of sensor networks and multi-robot systems, fully decentralized estimation techniques are of particular interest. As the required elimination of the complex dependencies between estimates generally yields inconsistent results, several approaches, e.g., covariance intersection, maintain consistency by providing conservative estimates. Unfortunately, these estimates are often too conservative and therefore, much less informative than a corresponding centralized approach. In this paper, we provide a concept that conservatively decorrelates the estimates while bounding the unknown correlations as closely as possible. For this purpose, known independent quantities, such as measurement noise, are explicitly identified and exploited. Based on tight covariance bounds, the new approach allows for an intuitive and systematic derivation of appropriate tailor-made filter equations and does not require heuristics. Its performance is demonstrated in a comparative study within a typical SLAM scenario.},

  Abstract                 = {A common approach to attack the simultaneous localization and mapping problem (SLAM) is to consider factor-graph formulations of the underlying filtering and estimation setup. While Kalman filter-based methods provide an estimate for the current pose of a robot and all landmark positions, graph-based approaches take not only the current pose into account but also the entire trajectory of the robot and have to solve a nonlinear least-squares optimization problem. Using graph-based representations has proven to be highly scalable and very accurate as compared with traditional filter-based approaches. However, biased measurements as well as unmodeled correlations can lead to a sharp deterioration in the estimation quality and hence require careful consideration. In this paper, a method to incorporate biased or dependent measurement information is proposed that can easily be integrated into existing optimization algorithms for graph-based SLAM. For biased sensor data, techniques from ellipsoidal calculus are employed to compute the corresponding information matrices. Dependencies among noise terms are treated by a generalization of the covariance intersection concept. The treatment of both biased and correlated sensor data rest upon the inflation of the involved error matrices. Simulations are used to discuss and evaluate the proposed method.},

In this paper, the same trick is generalized to nonlinear models and non-Gaussian process noise. The probability density of the joint process noise is split into an exponential mixture of transition densities. By this means, the process noise is modeled to independently affect the local system models.

It is shown that pathwise connected sets and their convex hulls
describe the same ignorance. Thus, an exact algorithm is derived,

in the case of a proper parametrization. Since the estimator
delivers a convex hull of densities as output, the theoretical

sets of densities. The derived filter is illustrated by means of an

In general, the estimation quality depends on the amount of sensor data that can be exploited. However, missing observations do not necessarily impair the estimation quality but may also convey exploitable information on the system state.

In this paper, a hybrid Kalman filter concept is employed that allows using both stochastic and set-membership representations of information. In particular, the latter representation is intended to account for negative information, which can often be easily described as a bounded set in the measurement space. Depending on the type of information, the filtering step of the proposed estimator adaptively switches between Gaussian and ellipsoidal noise representations.

This paper explicates how stochastic and set-membership uncertainties can simultaneously be treated within this information form and compared to the Kalman filter, it becomes apparent that the quality of some required approximations is enhanced.},

  Abstract                 = {The problem of fusing state estimates is encountered in many network-based multi-sensor applications. The majority of distributed state estimation algorithms are designed to provide multiple estimates on the same state, and track-to-track fusion then refers to the task of combining these estimates. While linear fusion only requires the joint cross-covariance matrix to be known, dependencies between estimates in nonlinear estimation problems have to be represented by high-dimensional probability density functions. In general, storing and keeping track of nonlinear dependencies is too cumbersome. However, this paper demonstrates that estimates represented by Gaussian mixtures prove to be an important exception to this rule. The dependency structure can as well be characterized in terms of a higher-dimensional Gaussian mixture. The different processing steps of distributed nonlinear state estimation, i.e., prediction, filtering, and fusion, are studied in light of the joint density representation. The presented concept is complemented with different simpler suboptimal representations of the dependency structure between Gaussian mixture densities.},

  Abstract                 = {For decentralized fusion problems, ellipsoidal intersection has been proposed as an efficient fusion rule that provides less conservative results as compared to the well-know covariance intersection method. Ellipsoidal intersection relies on the computation of a common estimate that is shared by the estimates to be fused. In this paper, an algebraic reformulation of ellipsoidal intersection is discussed that circumvents the computation of the common estimate. It is shown that ellipsoidal intersection corresponds to an internal ellipsoidal approximation of the intersection of covariance ellipsoids. An interesting result is that ellipsoidal intersection can be computed with the aid of the Bar-Shalom/Campo fusion formulae. This is achieved by assuming a specific correlation structure between the estimates to be fused.},

  Abstract                 = {Distributed implementations of state estimation algorithms generally have in common that each node in a networked system computes an estimate on the entire global state. Accordingly, each node has to store and compute an estimate of the same state vector irrespective of whether its sensors can only observe a small part of it. In particular, the task of monitoring large-scale phenomena renders such distributed estimation approaches impractical due to the sheer size of the corresponding state vector. In order to reduce the workload of the nodes, the state vector to be estimated is subdivided into smaller, possibly overlapping parts. In this situation, fusion does not only refer to the computation of an improved estimate but also to the task of reassembling an estimate for the entire state from the locally computed estimates of unequal state vectors. However, existing fusion methods require equal state representations and, hence, cannot be employed. For that reason, a fusion strategy for estimates of unequal and possibly overlapping state vectors is derived that minimizes the mean squared estimation error. For the situation of unknown cross-correlations between local estimation errors, also a conservative fusion strategy is proposed.},

  abstract  = {Distributed and decentralized processing and fusion of sensor data are becoming increasingly important. In view of the Internet of Things and the vision of ubiquitous sensing, designing and implementing multisensor state estimation algorithm have already become a key issue. A network of interconnected sensor devices is usually characterized by the idea to process and collect data locally and independently on the sensor nodes. However, this does not imply that the data are independent of each other, and the state estimation algorithms have to address possible interdependencies so as to avoid erroneous data fusion results.
Dependencies among local estimates generally can be traced back to common sensor information and common process noise. A wide variety of Kalman filtering schemes allow for the treatment of dependent data in centralized, distributed, and decentralized networks of sensor nodes, but making the right choice is itself dependent upon analyzing and weighing up the different advantages and disadvantages. This chapter discusses different strategies to identify and treat dependencies among Kalman filter estimates while pointing out advantages and challenges.},

problem in the fusion process relates to unknown common information that is shared by the estimates to be fused and is responsible for correlations. If the correlation structure is unknown to the fusion method,
conservative strategies are typically pursued. As such, the parameterization introduced by the ellipsoidal intersection method has been a novel approach to describe unknown correlations, though suitable
values for these parameters with proven consistency have not been identified yet. In this article, an extension of ellipsoidal intersection is proposed that guarantees consistent fusion results in the presence
of unknown common information. The bound used by the novel approach corresponds to computing an outer ellipsoidal bound on the intersection of inverse covariance ellipsoids. As a major advantage of this
inverse covariance intersection method, fusion results prove to be more accurate than those provided by the well-known covariance intersection method.},

The precise optical sorting of many bulk solids is still difficult due to the great technical effort necessary for transport and flow control. In this study, particle separation with an automated optical belt sorter is modeled numerically. The Discrete Element Method (DEM) is used to model the sorter and calculate the particle movement as well as particle – particle and particle – wall interactions. The particle ejection stage with air valves is described with the help of a MATLAB script utilizing particle movement information obtained with the DEM. Two models for predicting the particle movement between the detection and separation phase are implemented and compared. In the first model, it is assumed that the particles are moving with belt velocity and without any cross movements and a conventional line scan camera is used for particle detection. In the second model, a more sophisticated approach is employed where the particle motion is predicted with an area scan camera combined with a tracking algorithm. In addition, the influence of different operating parameters like particle shape or conveyor belt length on the separation quality of the system is investigated. Results show that numerical simulations can offer detailed insight into the operation performance of optical sorters and help to optimize operating parameters. The area scan camera approach was found to be superior to the standard line scan camera model in almost all investigated categories.},

More precisely, we utilize an algorithm for optimal distributed estimation in order to obtain local estimates whose combination yields the globally optimal estimate. When the interconnectivity is high, the local estimates are almost optimal, which motivates the application of the principle of separation. Thus, we optimize the controller and finally obtain a flexible algorithm, whose quality is evaluated in different scenarios. In applications where the strong requirements on a perfect communication cannot be guaranteed, we derive quality bounds by help of a detailed evaluation of the algorithm. When information is regularly exchanged, it is demonstrated that the algorithm performs almost optimally and therefore, offers system designers a flexible and easy to implement approach. The field of applications lies within the area of strongly networked systems, in particular, when communication disturbances cannot be foreseen or when the network structure is too complicated to apply optimized regulators.},

  Abstract                 = {The distributed processing of measurements and the subsequent data fusion is called Track-to-Track fusion. Although a solution for the Track-to-Track fusion that is equivalent to a central processing scheme has been proposed, this algorithm suffers from strict requirements regarding the local availability of knowledge about utilized models of the remote nodes. By means of simple examples, we investigate the effects of incorrectly assumed models and trace the errors back to a bias, which we derive in closed form. We propose an extension to the exact Track-to-Track fusion algorithm that corrects the bias after arbitrarily many time steps. This new approach yields optimal results when the assumptions about the measurement models are correct and otherwise still provides the exact value for the mean-squared-error matrix. The performance of this algorithm is demonstrated and applications are presented that, e.g.,~allow the employment of nonlinear filter methods.},

Covariance intersection is a wide-spread and efficient algorithm to fuse estimates under such uncertain conditions. Although different optimization criteria have been developed, the trace or determinant minimization of the fused covariance matrix seems to be most meaningful. However, this minimization requires numeric solutions of a convex optimization problem. We derive an algorithm to reduce this nonlinear optimization to the well-known polynomial root-finding problem. This allows us to present closed-form solutions for the determinant criterion when the dimension of the occurring covariance matrices is at most~4 and for the trace criterion when the dimension of the covariance matrices is at most~3. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach by means of a speed evaluation.},

Recently, an exact solution based on local estimation tracks has been proposed and an extension to cope with packet losses has been derived.

The key idea is to introduce augmented measurement vectors in the sensors that permit the optimization of local filter gains according to time-dependent measurement capabilities at the fusion center. In the most general form, the algorithm provides optimized estimates in sensor networks with packets delays and losses.

nodes and move within a WSN. The location of each person is calculated

mass casualty events, firefighter scenarios, hospitals or retirement homes for example.
For the location estimation on the sensor node, three derivatives of the
Kalman Filter and a closed-form solution (CFS) are applied, compared,
and evaluated in a real-world scenario. A prototype 65-node ZigBee WSN
is implemented and data are collected in in- and outdoor environments
with differently positioned on-body nodes. The described estimators are
then evaluated off-line on the experimentally collected data.
The goal of this paper is to present a comprehensive real-world evaluation of methods for
person localization in a WSN based on received signal strength (RSS) range measurements.
It is concluded that person localization in in- and outdoor environments is possible
under the considered conditions with the considered filters. The compared methods
allow for suffciently accurate localization results and are robust against
inaccurate range measurements.},

  Abstract                 = {State fusion is a method for merging multiple estimates of the same state into a single fused estimate. Dealing with multiple estimates is one of the main concerns in distributed state estimation, where an estimated value of the desired state vector is computed in each node of a networked system. Most solutions for distributed state estimation currently available assume that every node computes an estimate of the (same) global state vector. This assumption is impractical for systems observing large-area processes, due to the sheer size of the process state. A more feasible solutions is one where each node estimates a part of the global state vector, allowing different nodes in the network to have overlapping state elements. Although such an approach should be accompanied by a corresponding state fusion method, existing solutions cannot be employed as they merely consider fusion of two different estimates with equal state representations. Therefore, an empirical solution is presented for fusing two state estimates that have partially overlapping state elements. A justification of the proposed fusion method is presented, along with an illustrative case study for observing the temperature profile of a large rod, though a formal derivation is future research.},

Conditions are then derived under which the estimation error is bounded, followed by an assessment of two event sampling strategies when the estimator encounters two different types of disturbances: an impulse and a step disturbance. The sampling strategies are compared via four performance measures, such as estimation-error and communication resources.

Not receiving a new measurement is then interpreted as a sensor signal that has not violated the event criteria, which means that the signal is still within the triggering set defining the event. Such implied measurement information is exploited by the estimator, though it is only valid when no event occurred. The approach is thus sensitive to package loss and latency, as the estimator might be incorrect in assuming that no event took place. A solution to anticipate for package loss on the estimation error is studied in this article, and it is further turned into a first solution when the estimator is part of a feedback-control loop.},

Therefore, an existing state estimator is extended so to cope with event-based measurements successfully, i.e., curtail any diverging behavior in the estimation results. To that extent, a general formulation of event sampling is proposed. This formulation is used to set up a state estimator combining stochastic as well as set-membership measurement information according to a hybrid update: when an event occurs the estimated state is updated using the stochastic measurement received (positive information), while at periodic time instants no measurement is received (negative information) and the update is based on knowledge that the sensor value lies within a bounded subset of the measurement space. An illustrative example further shows that the developed estimator has an improved representation of estimation errors compared to a purely stochastic estimator for various event sampling strategies.},

an event on the sensor value rather than periodically

values are exploited in a state estimation procedure.
A solution to this issue has been found by developing
estimators that perform a state update at both the event
instants as well as periodically in time: when an event
occurs the estimated state is updated using the measurement received, while at periodic instants the update is
based on knowledge that the sensor value lies within a
bounded subset of the measurement space. Several solutions for event-based state estimation will be presented
in this chapter, either based on stochastic representations
of random vectors, on deterministic representations of
random vectors or on a mixture of the two. All solutions aim to limit the required computational resources
by deriving explicit solutions for computing estimation
results. Yet, the main achievement for each estimation
solution is that stability of the estimation results are (not directly) dependent on the employed event sampling
strategy. As such, changing the event sampling strategy does not imply to change the event-based estimator
as well. This aspect is also illustrated in a case study
of tracking the distribution of a chemical compound
effected by wind via a wireless sensor network.},

 The naive and intractable way of calculating the correct
 correlations would be to exchange information about every processed
 measurement between all nodes. Instead, we propose to obtain
 the correct correlations by keeping and processing a small set
 of deterministic samples on each node in parallel to the actual
 local state estimation. Sending these samples in addition to the
 local state estimate to the fusion center allows for correctly
 reconstructing the desired correlations between all estimates.
 In doing so, each node does not need any information about
 measurements processed on other nodes. We show the optimality
 of the proposed method by means of tracking an extended object

In order to trade off estimation accuracy against the costs of measurement transmission, we formulate the considered task as an optimal control problem, so that it fits into the broader class of sensor and measurement scheduling problems.

While state-of-the-art systems utilize scanning sensors such as line-scan cameras, advances in sensor technology have made application of area scanning sensors feasible. Provided a sufficiently high frame rate, objects can be observed at multiple points in time. By applying multiobject tracking, information about the objects contained in the material stream can be fused over time. Based on this information, our approach further allows predicting the position of each object for future points in time. While conventional systems typically apply a global, rather simple motion model, our approach includes an individual motion model for each object, which in turn allows estimating the point in time as well as the position when reaching the separation stage. In this contribution, we present results from our collaborative research project and summarize the present advances by discussing the potential of the application of area-scan sensors for sensor-based sorting. Among others, we introduce our simulation-driven approach and present results for physical separation efficiency for simulation-generated data, demonstrate the potential of using motion-based features for material classification and discuss real-time related challenges.}

  abstract  = {The computation of an estimate for the unknown state of a dynamical system is a central challenge in many disciplines and applications. In general, the estimation quality is directly tied to the amount of sensor data available to the state estimation system. However, insights from virtual or missing observations may also convey exploitable information on the system’s state. Such virtual measurement information may relate to constraints to which the state is subject. For instance, constraints to acceleration and turn rate of a mobile robot may apply and can be exploited. Analogously, missing observations that are attributable to obstacles can be translated into usable information, which is often referred to as negative sensor evidence. Such implicit information has to be reformulated into virtual measurement data in order to take advantage of it. As the Kalman filter and its derivatives are most widely used in state estimation applications, specific measurement and noise models for virtual observations are to be derived that can easily be integrated into the prediction-correction cycle of the Kalman filter. In this work, a set-membership representation of virtual measurement information is discussed.},
